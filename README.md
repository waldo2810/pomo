# Pomo

A TUI pomodoro that helps you focus more and prevent burnouts.

## Motivation

If you are like me, I most of the times like to have control of my apps through my terminal and I recently started using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/).

I found that I had to then use my phone to set timers or my watch to set stopwatches. I don't like using my phone for this because it induces me to use it. And I don't like using stopwatches because I always forget to stop on time.

I had something that only worked on my computer, to condition myself that computer = work = focus.

There are plenty of these TUI's out there like
- [charlieroth/pomotui](https://github.com/charlieroth/pomotui)
- [c0nradLC/homodoro](https://github.com/c0nradLC/homodoro)
- [And many others](https://www.google.com/search?q=pomodoro+tui&oq=pomodoro+tui&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgYIARBFGD0yBggCEEUYPDIGCAMQRRg90gEIMzIwNGowajGoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

I just wanted to do my own implementation.
